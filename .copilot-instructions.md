```instructions
When suggesting Python code:
- Use PEP8 and Black formatting.
- Add type hints (mypy strict mode).
- Prefer list comprehensions and context managers.
- Avoid nested loops or manual counters when possible.
- Follow pytest-style tests (not unittest).
- Assume the reader is an intermediate Python developer with a background in data, but not necessarily in software engineering.
- Bias towards writing more comments rather than fewer.
- Use `uv` to install packages and manage the virtual environment.
- Every Python file should include a module docstring; every function should include a docstring.
- This app will run in the cloud, and will be called using Dagster.
